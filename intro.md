ML-

ML is a subfield in Artificial intelligence. It involves learning models which allow the program to make predictions on data. There are two types of algorithms that are present regular and machine.

Regular Algo contains the specific number of steps that we defined but in Machine Algo it can make decisions that’s why it is different from regular Algo.

ML features-

As we know some of the problems solved by machine learning algorithms can’t be solved by brute force computations.

Machine learning employs complex calculations to solve problems.

Machine learning is heavily data-driven.

It is most popular in health care, financial markets etc.

Feature Selection is used in ML

1) To improve machine learning Algo by optimizing the training time.

2) To improve the accuracy of a model by choosing the right subset.

3) To reduce overfitting.

There are a few things that you have to understand in ML-

1-Training and testing data set

Training datasets should be greater than testing datasets.

2-Types of ML tasks:

Supervised learning-

expected outcome defined. it is also divided into regression and defined. Here you have to learn about linear regression(predict continuously valued quantities), loss functions, overfitting, and gradient descent.  Two methods of classification: logistic regression and SVMs.

Non-parametric learners: k-nearest neighbours, decision trees, random forests. cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble models.

Unsupervised learning –

output not defined. Clustering algorithms fall under this.

Clustering: k-means, hierarchical. Dimensionality reduction: principal components analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD).

Reinforcement learning

Following systems do not require labelled data for making predictions-

 Reward-based systems

 Clustering systems

 Reinforcement learning systems

To learn ML go through these things-

SupportVectorClassifier

Basic Math Concepts- Regression, Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, Accuracy

Python programming language with these libraries – Datetime, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

R for analytics and research. This language has the capability for stats analysis.

KNN(K-Nearest Neighbours) Algo-

1) Classification of the object is done by a majority vote of its neighbours.

2) Nearer neighbours have a higher vote than the more distant ones.

3) The algorithm does not attempt to construct a general internal model but compares the new problem with the instances seen in training.

SVM(Support vector machine) -

1)SVMs are supervised, learning models

2) The algorithm builds a model that assigns new data into one of the categories that it has learned about in the training phase

3) There could be more than one hyperplane dividing the data space for making the classification.

optimal hyperplane in a Support Vector Machine describes a larger margin.

The random forest cannot predict beyond the range in the training data.

Then the artificial neural network generates a “poor or undesired” output then

The system alters the weights to improve subsequent results

 Data Engineering is creating huge opportunities for Indian IT Services companies. Most of the Digital transformation deals that are being discussed with our clients involve Data Analysts, Engineers, and Architects. AI / ML that work on such Data engineering projects need consultants who are trained in advanced statistics and mathematical skills.

NLP- Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Linguistics refers to language. it can help computers analyse text easily i.e detect spam emails etc.

Data science- In Data science we use the pandas library to handle a large amount of data and produce graphs.

Text data analysis using JS
most machine learning is written in python

NLP with JS
help app users decode text messages from potential interests. After analyzing the text, the API returns either “sympathetic friend” or “passionate lover” back to the user to identify if the relationship will end up being platonic or romantic.

Natural.js- package for Node.js that helps deal with natural language. it can do a sentiment analysis from the box and without any setup.
The package supports the Naive Bayes classifier and logistic regression.

Brain.js
This library helps you to build neural networks.
They reflect the behavior of biological neurons that are great at recognizing patterns.
